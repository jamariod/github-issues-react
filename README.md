# App Structure

# Scaffold the app with create-react-app

# Remove the default information from App.js

# Leave App.js as a FUNCTIONAL component

# Create a CLASS based component called `IssueList`

# This component will hold the array of issues from the API

# The issues will be stored in the component's STATE

# This component will pass data for each issue as a PROP into a child component

# Create a FUNCTIONAL component called `Issue`

# This is the child component of `IssueList`

# It will receive issue data as a PROP

# This component will render the issue data

# The component should show the issue title, URL (as a link!), and body
